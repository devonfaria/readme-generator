## Roadmap

In the future of our project, we would like to add more search filters such as looking for covers, kareoke versions, original tracks, etc. more specifically. Also, we would like to alter our API fetch from Musixmatch to Genius, as Genius has a more robust library and more commonly has information like correct lyrics and video URLs.
