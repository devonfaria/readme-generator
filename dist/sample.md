## Installation

No install necessary. You can access the webpage as a deployed page in GitHub.
 
## Usage

Simply type an artist, track, or a portion of lyrics into the search bar, and then choose one of the generated results. You can click the play button on the embedded Youtube Video, or the Go Back button to search another track.
 
## Contribution Guidelines

No one is allowed to contribute to this project. It is a final product.
 
## Testing Instructions

Visit the deployed page and attempt to search a query in the displayed search bar. Unless the application has run out of API calls for the day, it will produce results. Otherwise, it will not return any result.
